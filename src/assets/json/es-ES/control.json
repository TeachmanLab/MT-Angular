Panic attacks are useful when the alarm system alerts one to real danger, such as when Malik’s alarm system alerted him to the danger of nearly hitting a child with his car in Session 1.

The more they fear these sensations, the more aware of the sensations they become. A fear of panic attacks ultimately can cause the attacks to be become more intense and frequent."

For example, people who enter a party with the belief “No one will ever like me” may focus on unfriendly faces, interpret them as evidence of rejection, and remember them more clearly than friendly faces.

For example, if a girl’s mother is afraid of dogs and the girl sees her mother avoid them, the girl may come to believe that dogs are dangerous and should be avoided, even if she liked dogs before."

One key reason is that people try to escape from their strong feelings of anxiety, which is understandable.

For example, a person with social anxiety disorder might avoid public speaking completely or give a talk only when she can wear black clothes so that no one would notice her sweating."

But when people rely on these strategies they do not learn that the object or situation they fear is not dangerous. They also do not learn that the anxiety will decrease on its own after a while and that they can handle their feelings with more adaptive coping skills. Finally, they do not have the chance to correct their cognitive distortions. As a result, their anxiety persists. For example, as long as a person with social anxiety disorder avoids other people, the person will not have the chance to correct a belief such as “No one will ever like me.” In turn, such beliefs and cognitive distortions only increase the likelihood that the person will keep avoiding others and using safety behavior (1)."

Just as a sprinter can race at full speed for only a short distance, intense anxiety must subside at some point. This is true even if people approach feared situations step by step and start with smaller fears. It is not necessary to face one’s biggest fear from the start. In addition, people typically fear things more than their danger warrants, but when people do not approach these things, they do not learn their real danger.",
